# OARnet-Exercise
I only got the basic functions to work with my 2 hours up. I was only able to make it handle floats as an additional feature. If I had more time I probably would have added a try block for any errors so it would run smoothly. I made it so that the user enters the operand, then the two numbers it would like it to operate on so 10 + 5 would have to be entered in as ('+', 10, 5). I'm not sure if that is exactly how I was supposed to do it based on the format of the question but ideally I would have instead had the user enter it as a string.
